# Pig game

This game is a 2p game! The idea is to get the highest number on your claim. But if the dice turns to 1, it is the next players move, and your current score resets. How many clicks can you get?



This game was made early in the learning process, and was a fun challenge! Learning about arrays, how to store values and updating it to the DOM. You can try it out <a href="https://martinfjeld.github.io/pig-game/">here</a>!
